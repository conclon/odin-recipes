            Steps:
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, stir together the water, maple syrup, and the yeast. Set aside for 5 minutes, until the yeast is foamy.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, place the flour and salt. Mix on medium speed until combined. Add the yeast mixture and 1 Tbsp of the olive oil. Mix on medium speed until the dough forms into a ball around the hook, 5 to 6 minutes. If the dough is too dry to form a ball, add water &frac12; tablespoon at a time until the mixture comes together. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead into a smooth ball.</li>
            <Li>Brush a large bowl with the remaining 1 teaspoon of olive oil and place the dough inside. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to rise until the dough has doubled in size, about 1 hour.</Li>
            <li>Place the tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, salt, and oregano in a food processor and blend until combined.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 500&deg;F</li>
            <li>Spread the pizza sauce onto the dough. Top with the fresh mozzarella and tomatoes and bake 10 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is browned. Remove from the oven and top with fresh basil leaves and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Drizzle with olive oil and serve.</li>
